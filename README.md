This branch is spiritually forked from https://github.com/udon01/other/tree/main/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%B8%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BCV%E7%94%A8R5.ALL%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C%E3%83%84%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB.
(I belive extract codes different. But it's forked from this codes. This is reason why the tool was made by Windows Form and why works with D&D.)
