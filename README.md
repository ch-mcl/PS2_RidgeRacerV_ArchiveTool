# Usage
## Extract
1. Prepare these files from your "Ridge Racer V"
Archive file
- R5.ALL
Execution file of Ridge Racer V

## File Extension
You can see "RR5.RAW" and "RR5.LZ" extension files.
Those extensions are defined by me.
And "RR5.LZ" needs decompress by LZSS(Customized for Ridge Racer V).

## Ridge Racer Arcade Battle
This tool also able to extract files from "Ridge Racer Arcade Battle RRV3 Ver A". (Building is potentially. Because I never tested.)

You needs alternatively preapre those files.

- RRV1_A (instead of R5.ALL)
- rrv3vera.ic002 (instead of Execution file)

# Fork
This branch is spiritually forked from [here](https://github.com/udon01/other/tree/main/%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%B8%E3%83%AC%E3%83%BC%E3%82%B5%E3%83%BCV%E7%94%A8R5.ALL%E6%93%8D%E4%BD%9C%E3%83%84%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AB).
(I belive extract codes different. But it's forked from this codes. This is reason why the tool was made by Windows Form and why works with D&D.)
